🎵 Music and Mental Health: Analyzing the connection

📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between music listening habits and mental health. Using data analysis techniques, we assess how different factors—such as genre preference, listening frequency, and self-reported well-being—correlate with emotional and psychological states.

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
	•	Data Visualization (Power BI, Seaborn heatmaps, bar charts)

📊 Key Findings
	•	There is a measurable but weak correlation between music preferences and mental health.
	•	Active music listeners show more significant emotional responses.
	•	The impact of music varies by individual, with some genres promoting relaxation while others may induce stress.
	•	Further research is needed to explore music as a potential therapeutic tool.
